# Notes-App

## Description

This application is for my assignment 1 for SIT313.

For my first assignment, I was required to explore the capabilities of Xamarin.iOS and create a fully functioning application for iOS devices.

Therefore, I have created a Notes App that uses Navigation Controllers, Custom Alert ViewControllers and segues through storyboard for the functioning.

The events that are currently implemented are as follows:

- The user can create a note.
- The user can view the different notes and their descriptions. 
- The app is compatible with both portrait and landscape rotations for all iOS devices.

## Compilation Instructions

- Open the application in Visual Studio. You can plug in a real device or use a simulator to run and test the application.
- Select the device from the top left corner right beside the play button.
- After selecting the device press the play button to install the application onto your device or the simulator and it will run.
